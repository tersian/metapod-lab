# metapod-lab

This is the repo for scripts to setup our Metapod lab. The passwords included in the files are no longer used, so don't get all excited, they don't work anymore and the lab changes IPs frequently. No free OpenStack for you!

I will be refactoring these horrible bash scripts into puppet eventually, then into python.

Enjoy.
